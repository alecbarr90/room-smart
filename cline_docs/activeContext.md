## Active Context

**What you're working on now:**

   - Improved the layout and styling of search components
   - Added automatic search when changing category filter
   - Added helpful user instructions

**Next steps:**

1. Add Technique Selection/Save Animations:
   - Create save animations (sparkle effects, flying animations)
   - Implement selection animations (accordion effects, highlights)
   - Design success feedback system with milestones
   - Optimize animations for performance

3. Develop Technique Combinations:
   - Define complementary technique pairs
   - Build combinations interface ("POWER COMBOS!")

   - Add visual representation system
