## Active Context

**What you're working on now:**

I am currently working on improving the search functionality in the "How to Be the Smartest Person in the Room" website.

**Recent changes:**

1. Created the Memory Bank files to document the project context.
2. Analyzed the existing code to understand the project structure and functionality.
3. Improved the search functionality:
   - Made the search input field more prominent and user-friendly
   - Added Enter key press functionality for searching
   - Removed the keyword selection section for simpler UX
   - Improved the layout and styling of search components
   - Added automatic search when changing category filter
   - Added helpful user instructions

**Next steps:**

1. Test the improved search functionality to ensure it works as expected.
2. Consider adding additional features such as:
   - Saving search results
   - Sorting search results
   - Highlighting search terms in results
