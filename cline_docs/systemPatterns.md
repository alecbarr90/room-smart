## System Patterns

**How the system is built:**

The system is likely a single-page application (SPA) built with React. The `App.js` file is likely the main component, and other components are used to build the user interface.

**Key technical decisions:**

*   The project uses React for the front-end development.
*   The project includes testing files (`App.test.js`, `setupTests.js`), indicating that testing is part of the development process.

**Architecture patterns:**

The project likely follows a component-based architecture, which is common in React applications.
