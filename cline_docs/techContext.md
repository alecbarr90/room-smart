**Development setup:**

*   The project uses `react-scripts`, which means it was likely created with Create React App.
*   Dependencies are managed with npm.
*   The `start` script runs the development server.
*   The `build` script builds the application for production.
*   The `test` script runs the tests.
*   The `deploy` script deploys the application to GitHub Pages.

**Technical constraints:**

*   The project is limited by the capabilities of React and the libraries used.
*   The project is deployed to GitHub Pages, which has some limitations on server-side functionality.
